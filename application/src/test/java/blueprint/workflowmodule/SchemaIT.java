/**
 * What this blueprint is about: every table exists, and none of them was created by
 * VanillaBP, by Hibernate or by the engine.
 *
 * <p>
 * That nothing created them at runtime is not asserted here but configured:
 * {@code vanillabp.outbox.create-schema} is off, {@code ddl-auto} is {@code validate} and
 * the Camunda 7 adapter's {@code database-schema-update} is off. Booting is therefore the
 * proof, and this test says which tables the migration was supposed to bring.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Who owns what is part of the assertion. One history holds them all, and every changeset is
 * recorded under the logical path of the changelog which declared it, so the rows of the
 * workflow module stay the module's however the application included them. Were that path
 * missing, a module's changesets would be recorded under the application's file name and a
 * later version of the module could no longer recognize its own history.
 * </p>
